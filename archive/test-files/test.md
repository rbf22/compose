# Compose Feature Test

This is a **bold** word and this is *italic* text. You can also have ***bold italic*** formatting.

Here's some `inline code` in the middle of a sentence.

## Code Blocks

Here's a Python code block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Compose!")
    return "success"

hello_world()
```

And here's a JavaScript example:

```javascript
const compose = {
    name: "Compose",
    version: "0.1.0",
    features: ["markdown", "pdf", "html"]
};

console.log(compose);
```

## Math Support

### Inline Math
The famous equation is $E = mc^2$.

### Block Math
Here's a more complex equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)
$$

## Images

Here's an example image reference:

![Sample Image](sample.png "A sample image")
